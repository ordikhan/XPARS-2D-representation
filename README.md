# XPARS-2D-representation
This repository contains the genetic code of the Chart-base two-dimensional representation of the CVD risk score part of the published article project ("An evolutionary machine learning algorithm for cardiovascular disease risk prediction"). The method is more widely used, which combines BP and cholesterol levels.  The chart was composed of same-sized blocks, each representing four categories for BP and five for cholesterol, making each block a 4Ã—5 matrix. This is the code that uses only 6 risk factor ('sex', 'whr',  "smoker", 'age', 'blood_pressure' 'cholesterol').
